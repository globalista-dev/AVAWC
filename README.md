# AVAWC (Actual Vanilla Wither Cages)

This is a pretty simple mod that makes the Block of Netherite immune to wither attacks and changes its blast resistance. It is similar to my other mod, Fabric Reinforced Obsidian, but it is more vanilla friendly. Also, it can (and, honestly, should) be used server-side only (or in singleplayer).
